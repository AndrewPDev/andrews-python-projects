# Andrew's Python Projects

A collection of Python tools and utilities for various purposes.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and tools developed for educational and professional use. Currently featuring a hash identification tool for cybersecurity analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hash Identifier Tool

**File:** `hash_tester_main.py`

A powerful hash identification tool that analyzes hash strings and identifies the most likely hash algorithm based on pattern matching and characteristic analysis.

**Features:**
- Supports 15+ hash types including MD5, SHA variants, bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2
- Single hash analysis with confidence scoring
- Batch file processing for multiple hashes
- Character set analysis and security recommendations
- Interactive command-line interface

**Supported Hash Types:**
- **Cryptographic Hashes:** MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2
- **Windows Hashes:** NTLM, LM Hash
- **Application-Specific:** MySQL5, WordPress, Drupal 7, Joomla

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses standard library only)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndrewPDev/andrews-python-projects.git
   cd andrews-python-projects
   ```

2. Make script executable (Unix/Linux):
   ```bash
   chmod +x hash_tester_main.py
   ```

### Running the Hash Identifier

```bash
python hash_tester_main.py
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Single Hash Analysis
```
Enter hash to identify (or command): 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
```

### Batch File Analysis
```
Enter hash to identify (or command): file:sample_hashes.txt
```

### Sample Hash File Format
Create a text file with one hash per line:
```
# Sample hash file - comments start with #
5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

```

## üìä Output Example

```
============================================================
Hash Analysis for: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
============================================================

Found 3 possible match(es):

1. MD5 - MD5 (Message Digest 5)
   Confidence: 80%
   Example: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

2. NTLM - NTLM Hash
   Confidence: 50%
   Example: b4b9b02e6f09a9bd760f388b67351e2b

3. LM - LM Hash (LAN Manager)
   Confidence: 50%
   Example: aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee

Additional Analysis:
   Length: 32 characters
   Character set: Hexadecimal (0-9, a-f)
   Most likely: MD5 (80%)
   WARNING: This appears to be a weak hash algorithm!
```

## üîß Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `help` | Display usage information |
| `quit`, `exit`, `q` | Exit the program |
| `file:filename.txt` | Analyze multiple hashes from file |

## Security Notes

- **MD5 and SHA-1** are considered cryptographically weak and should not be used for security purposes
- **bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2** are recommended for password hashing
- This tool is for **authorized testing only** - ensure proper permissions before use
- Always verify hash identification results with additional testing
